Project Description: StudyBuddy – Smart Study Planner (with Gemini AI)
:dart: Goal:
Build a full-stack study planner app using Next.js that helps students organize their study time. The app will use Gemini AI (Google) to create personalized study tasks based on the student’s input.
:brain: What the App Will Do:
Allow students to sign up and log in
Ask for study preferences:
Subject (e.g., Math, Science)
Time available per day
Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
Send this data to Gemini AI
Gemini will return a list of study tasks (4–6 per request)
Show these tasks on the dashboard
Let students:
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks
See their study progress
:computer: Pages You Will Create:
/signup – Register a new student
/login – Login page
/generate-tasks – Form to get AI-generated tasks
/dashboard – View all tasks, mark as done, delete

Create 5 study tasks for a 9th grade student studying Science. The student has 1.5 hours available and prefers medium-level difficulty.
Gemini will return:
Task 1: Revise Chapter 4 – Ecosystems
Task 2: Watch one video on Food Chains
Task 3: Make flashcards for 10 key terms
Task 4: Do 3 practice questions
Task 5: Review notes from last test
You will display these tasks on the dashboard and save them in MongoDB.
